# RESTful-microservice-web-app


## Created a demo e-commerce application consisting of 3 microservices (a frontend, cart microserves that handles items in a user's cart, and a registration microservices that handles user registration). Created 6 docker images for each microservice including each of thier own independent databases, then deployed the application on Google cloud using a kubernetes cluster.
